# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#

    intro_html: <p>My farm is in Matsumoto, Nagano! To grow my veggies, I use the soil and native plants in the field, fallen leaves, rye straw, and rice bran–and that’s it! I focus much of time trying to build up the biodiversity and healthy ecosystem of beneficial soil microbes on my farm. In other words, I don’t just grow vegetables, I manage a whole ecosystem of plants, animals (including myself!) and microbes so all the living things can exist together, share resources and support each other. I try my best not to damage the environment or use its limited resources in excess.</p><p>I may have to fight with the rough conditions in Mother Nature at times, but most of the time she helps me out and my vegetables end up with complex and delicious flavors. Even though I can’t produce huge harvests, it’s my hope that I can share at least some of my vegetables with others, so you can get try them for yourself and experience their natural taste. As I continue to farm, I’m constantly making new discoveries, trying to learn as much as can, and always working on moving my dream forward!</p>
